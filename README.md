Forked from VK5ABN's cudaSDR repo. 
Now uses WDSP library.
In the process of updating to use QOpenGLWidgets.

This is a copy of VK5ABN, Berndt's cuSDR source
derived from his post: http://www.ping.net.au/20140126_cuSDR64src.tar.gz

This is originally cuSDR written by Hermann, DL3HVH

I added local sound and up'd the number of receivers to 20.

Using the Hermes-Lite CVA8 (with some minor protocol changes)
I am able to do 16 rcvrs @ 96Khz and 9 @ 192Khz:

Using the Hermes-Lite CVA9 (larger FPGA)
I am able to do 16 rcvrs @ 384Khz, but very CPU intensive on a quad i7.

NOTES:

Greater than 7 rcvrs requires a protocol change which currently only
the Hermes-Lite rtl supports.

I have only compiled and used this on linux.

QT_SELECT=qt5 qmake cudaSDR.pro

make -j9

To make for Hermes-Lite edit Makefile and add -DHL at the end of DEFINES
